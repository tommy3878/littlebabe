% Timed version of Process Hubble telescope images
% This script times how long your code takes to run
% It is a cut down version of the ProcessHubbleImages script
% with no user interaction and excludes the time take to read and write
% friles from disc (as this can take a long time if writing to a
% flashdrive)
%
% Use this script to measure your performance once you have completed tasks
% 1 through 8 inclusive (The bonus mark tasks are not timed)
% To obtain a time simply hit the "Run button".
%
% Note hat when developing it can be helpful to use the
% "Run and time" button instead to profile your code.  This will let you know
% where bottle necks are. Be aware however that using the "Run and time"
% button will slow  execution time down substantially as Matlab uses a
% lot of resources while profiling your code.
